# SEO Best Practices for Modern Web Apps

Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is crucial for ensuring your website ranks well in search results.

## Essential SEO Elements

### 1. Meta Tags

Always include proper meta tags in your pages:

- Title tag (50-60 characters)
- Meta description (150-160 characters)
- Open Graph tags for social sharing

### 2. Sitemap

A sitemap helps search engines discover and index your pages. Generate a `sitemap.xml` file that lists all your important URLs.

### 3. Robots.txt

Use `robots.txt` to control which pages search engines can crawl:

```txt
User-agent: *
Allow: /
Disallow: /admin
Sitemap: https://yoursite.com/sitemap.xml
```

### 4. Structured Data

Implement JSON-LD structured data to help search engines understand your content better.

## Performance Matters

Page speed is a ranking factor. Optimize your site by:

- Using image optimization
- Implementing lazy loading
- Minimizing JavaScript bundles
- Leveraging caching strategies

## Conclusion

Implementing these SEO best practices will help improve your site's visibility and user experience.
