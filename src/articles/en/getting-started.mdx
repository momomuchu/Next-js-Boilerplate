# Getting Started with Next.js

Welcome to this comprehensive guide on getting started with Next.js!

## What is Next.js?

Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications. You use React Components to build user interfaces, and Next.js for additional features and optimizations.

## Key Features

- **Server-Side Rendering**: Improve SEO and initial page load performance
- **Static Site Generation**: Generate static pages at build time
- **API Routes**: Build API endpoints as part of your Next.js app
- **File-based Routing**: Automatic routing based on file structure

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js app, run:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

Your app will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Next Steps

Now that you have your app running, you can:

1. Explore the file structure
2. Create your first page
3. Add styling with Tailwind CSS
4. Deploy your app to Vercel

Happy coding!
